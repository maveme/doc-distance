In recent years, successful UIST submissions have focused on domains including: input and output devices, augmented/virtual reality, programming tools, mobile interaction, haptic and tactile interfaces, human-robot interaction, AI and HCI, fabrication, design and prototyping tools, creativity tools, ubiquitous computing, accessibility, visualization, information management, wearable computing, social computing, toolkits, education, crowdsourcing, and computer-supported cooperative work. We look forward to relevant submissions in novel domains as well.
